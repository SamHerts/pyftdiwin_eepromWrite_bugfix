## PyFtdiWin vs. PyFtdi

PyFtdiWin is a fork of PyFtdi. The design objective of the PyFtdiWin fork is to
provide a better out-of-the-box experience by supporting the default Windows
plug-and-play drivers provided by FTDI.

PyFtdi only supports libusb-compatible drivers, which requires you to swap
the official drivers for a libusb-compatible driver using tools such as Zadig.
As Windows serial ports and many other tools expect the default FTDI D2XX
drivers, you will find yourself swapping drivers back-and-forth when
using PyFtdi with your FTDI devices.

PyFtdiWin is currently undergoing more testing and might be merged into the
PyFtdi upstream when appropriate.

The source code for the **PyFtdiWin** package can be found at GitHub at <https://github.com/mariusgreuel/pyftdiwin>.

## Overview

PyFtdi aims at providing a user-space driver for popular FTDI devices,
implemented in pure Python language.

Suported FTDI devices include:

* UART and GPIO bridges

  * FT232R (single port, 3Mbps)
  * FT230X/FT231X/FT234X (single port, 3Mbps)

* UART, GPIO and multi-serial protocols (SPI, I2C, JTAG) bridges

  * FT2232C/D (dual port, clock up to 6 MHz)
  * FT232H (single port, clock up to 30 MHz)
  * FT2232H (dual port, clock up to 30 MHz)
  * FT4232H (quad port, clock up to 30 MHz)

## Features

PyFtdi currently supports the following features:

* UART/Serial USB converter, up to 12Mbps (depending on the FTDI device
  capability)
* GPIO/Bitbang support, with 8-bit asynchronous, 8-bit synchronous and
  8-/16-bit MPSSE variants
* SPI master, with simultanous GPIO support, up to 12 pins per port,
  with support for non-byte sized transfer
* I2C master, with simultanous GPIO support, up to 14 pins per port
* Basic JTAG master capabilities
* EEPROM support (some parameters cannot yet be modified, only retrieved)
* Experimental CBUS support on selected devices, 4 pins per port
